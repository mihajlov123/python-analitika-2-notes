This library has more than 2500 algorithms dedicated to computer vision and ML. It can track human movements, detect moving objects, extract 3d models, stitch images together to create a high-resolution image, exploring the AR possibilities. It is used in various CCTV monitoring activities by many governments, especially in China and Isreal. Also, the major camera companies in the world use OpenCv for making their technology smart and user-friendly.\n",

    "- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/): TensorFlow is a library developed by the Google Brain team for the primary purpose of Deep Learning and Neural Networks. It allows easy distribution of work onto multiple CPU cores or GPU cores, and can even distribute the work to multiple GPUs.  TensorFlow uses Tensors for this purpose. Tensors can be defined as a container that can store N-dimensional data along with its linear operations. Although it is production-ready and does support reinforcement learning along with Neural networks, it is not commercially supported which means any bug or defect can be resolved only by community help.\n",
    "- [Keras:](https://keras.io/): Keras provides a Python interface of Tensorflow Library especially focused on AI neural networks. The earlier versions also included many other backends like Theano, Microsoft cognitive platform, and PlaidMl. Keras contains standard blocks of commonly used neural networks, and also the tools to make image and text processing faster and smoother. Apart from standard blocks of neural networks, it also provides re-occurring neural networks.\n",
    "- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/): Pytorch is a Facebook-developed ML library that is based on the Torch Library (an open-source ML library written in Lua Programming language). The project is written in Python Web Development, C++, and CUDA languages. Along with Python, PyTorch has extensions in both C and C++ languages. It is a competitor to Tensorflow as both of these libraries use tensors but it is easier to learn and has better integrability with Python. Although it supports NLP, but the main focus of the library is only on developing and training deep learning models only. \n",

    "- [Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)](https://www.nltk.org/): NLTK is the widely used library for Text Classification and Natural Language Processing. It performs word Stemming, Lemmatizing, Tokenization, and searching a keyword in documents. The library can be further used for sentiment analysis, understanding movie reviews, food reviews, text-classifier, checking and censoring the vulgarised words from comments, text mining, and many other human language-related operations. The wider scope of its uses includes AI-powered chatbots which need text processing to train their models to identify and also create sentences important for machine and human interaction in the upcoming future.\n",
